# OpenSwab - COVID-19 Swab Prototype

## About

<img src="exports/renders/openswab-pyramid-95-vertical.png" align="right" width="150">

Prototype of a Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab used to collect samples for COVID-19
testing.

A NP swab is a flexible stick with a small brush at the end. The swab is
inserted in the nasal cavity to gather biological material which is held in the
brush hollow stem.

The swabs used in COVID-19 testing cannot be made of materials like cotton and
wood, that is because they would affect the RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) of the
collected sample.

Because of the precision and accuracy required this swab is expected to be
printed by a SLA 3D printer using biocompatible resin.

At the time of this writing there is a global shortage of personal protection
equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies, including testing swabs. This swab
was designed and created in a effort to provide a possible solution to this
problem.

This prototype is currently being reviewed by health authorities along many
other designs. Nevertheless, it hasn't been tested, validated or approved by
any organization.

## Product Features

- Parameterizable dimensions: The design was made in a way that facilitate to
change  and configure new swab dimensions as needed.

- Anatomic Design: The Swab is designed with a standard size and a head that
fulfills the purpose of collecting material efficiently without generating as
much discomfort in the patient.

- Material: The swabs used in COVID-19 testing cannot be made of materials
like cotton and wood, that is because they would affect the RNA (Ribonucleic
Acid) of the collected sample. This is why OpenSwab is designed to be printed
in a SLA 3D printer ensuring the use of synthetic materials with their
respective sterilization.

- Ergonomic Design: It has a diameter and overall length suitable for handling
by medical personnel.

- Breakpoint: The swab has a breakpoint that allows its storage in Transport
Tubes after collecting the sample.


## Product Specs

The predefined swab measurements are detailed below. Nevertheless, one of the
advantages of OpenSwab is that all these dimensions are easily configurable. See
[Swab Configuration](#swab-configuration) section.
